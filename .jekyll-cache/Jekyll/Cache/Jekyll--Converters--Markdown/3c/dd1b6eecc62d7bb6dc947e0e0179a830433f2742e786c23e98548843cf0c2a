I"Ñ<p>I encounter ADMM several time, did go through the derivation 2 times at
least, still I cannot write it down from scratch when a friend of mine
asked me about it. This note is to summary my understand about it.</p>

<h1 id="sec:derivation">Derivation</h1>

<p>ADMM deals with an optimization problem in the following form:</p>

\[\begin{align*}
    &amp; \mathop{\mathrm{minimize}}\quad f(x) + g(z) \\
    &amp; \text{subject to } \quad Ax + Bz = c\end{align*}\]
