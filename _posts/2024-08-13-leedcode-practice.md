A summary of my strategy on solving programming problems on leetcode and the similar.

- Reading the book: Introduction to algorithms
- Approaches:

+ Incremental: insertion sort
+ Divide and conquer: the tell, recursive calls
+ The linear class O(n)
+ The DP: __optimal sub-structure__
+ Algorithms with aided data structures: heap, priority queue, balance binary tree


Proof and analysis:

- Loop invariant
- Termination


Thinking strategy:

- Find the smaller sub-problems:
+ Overlapping: DP
+ Non-overlapping: divide and conquer

Algorithm is a next class of closed-form solution, in which we are equipped with iterations, and branching conditions. Think about expressing solutions using these new operations. Data structure also gives us a variety of new operations.

One thing about DP presenting in the book: They always think of characterizing solution, while our thoughts start with chopping the problems into smaller pieces.
