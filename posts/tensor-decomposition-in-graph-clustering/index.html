<p>This is my very first technical report at Oregon State University. It was the final project report of course Matrix Analysis. This version has been undergone minor amendments after grading 90/100.</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Tensor decomposition has been propular for decades because of its distinctive characteristics compared to matrix.
There are many works dedicated to exploiting tensor potential through various areas, particularly in graph clustering. However, there is a lack of a clear connection between traditional clustering and tensor-based methods. Showing relation between these techniques under graph clustering problem would benefit for a deeper understanding as well as further directions to employ tensor techniques.</p>
<p>Moreover, tensor decomposition has many variants, such as Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD), and LL1 decomposition. While both of them are all compelling, but blunt applying these techniques would not produce any effective result.
This technical report aims to: firstly, linking tensor decomposition techniques to a very well-known $k$-mean clustering algorithm, and based on that, motivating the usage of LL1 decomposition over CPD in graph clustering problem.</p>
